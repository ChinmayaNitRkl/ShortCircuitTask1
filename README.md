We have been tasked with making a traffic Signal that switches from Green to Yellow and at last to Red normally and to add a 
Pedestrian button such that when pressed it would make the signal Red altogether for some time and then switch back to the 
original cycle.

Components Used :- 

1)Arduino Board

2)LEDs: Red, Yellow, Green

3)Push Button (for pedestrian crossing request)

4)Resistors (for LEDs and button)

5)Breadboard & Jumper Wires

I have used 3 basic functions from the Arduino documentation which are digitalRead, digitalWrite and most importantly the millis()
function which allowed me to initiate the Pedestrian function whilst the normal cycle was still running. I have applied a timer of 
5 secs after green, 2 secs after yellow, and again 5 secs after red.

And upon pressing the Push Button the cycle halts and it turns on to just Red for 5 secs after which it switches back into its 
original rythm.
The millis() function has been used instead of delay() to ensure non-blocking execution, allowing the system to respond to the 
pedestrian request even while in a cycle

How to Use ? =====>>>>

->Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.

How to Use ? ====>>>>

->Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.

->Observe the automatic Green â†’ Yellow â†’ Red cycle.

->Press the push button to trigger the pedestrian crossing mode.

->The Red light will turn on for 5 seconds, then the cycle resumes.

This project demonstrates basic traffic control logic while integrating a pedestrian-friendly crossing system. ðŸš¦
